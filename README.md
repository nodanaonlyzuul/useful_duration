# UsefulDuration

Finally - a useful way of measuring time in your applications.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'useful_duration'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install useful_duration

## Usage

> require 'useful_duration'

> include UsefulDuration

## Defining Your Own Duration
